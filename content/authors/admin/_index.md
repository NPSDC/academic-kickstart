I am a first year Ph.D. student at the Department ofComputer Science, University of Maryland, College Park. I am working with [Dr. Hector Corrada Bravo](http://hcbravo.org/), exploring approaches for the analysis of single cell data. I am interested in the development and application of statistical methods for the analysis of different high-throughput data.

Prior to joining UMD, I was at IIIT-Hyderabad, India working under [Dr. Vinod PK](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk/team.html). As a part of my MS, I built machine learning models for predicting stages of cancer integrating RNASeq and DNA Methylation data and explored the relationship between these two platforms [(link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AMXr2XkLY8bgizfaDQ1iNyMhlckBLzuX?usp=sharing). During the summer of 2017, I worked as an intern under [Dr. Simon Anders](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/Anders/default.shtml) at Heidelberg, Germany.

Outside academics, I can be found playing badminton or squash or reading history books.
